# Meteor Kickstart

This is a Meteor project stub. Feel free to fork it in order to kickstart a new project. 

Main features:
- **Webpack** for fast, near-realtime rebuilds.
- **React-Bootstrap** for building UIs quickly. See https://react-bootstrap.github.io
- **Flow Router**
- **Unit tests** with dispatch:mocha-phantomjs, Sinon and Chai

Gitlab continuous integration support:
- runs unit tests after each push
- builds a Docker image on demand (use Git tag "docker")

Also:
- aldeed:simple-schema
- aldeed:collection2

This project is based on https://github.com/thereactivestack/kickstart-meteor-react-flowrouter
Enjoy.
